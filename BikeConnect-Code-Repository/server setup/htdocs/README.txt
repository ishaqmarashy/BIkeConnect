index i used for random tests as well as the html files in admin
those are pages i'd like implemented php is working 
html page is ugly and is missing a few functions, its only a baseline on how to add these things

@ryan
i need a page that has a query line and a table template
dont be overwhelmed by the number of pages in there its just following a template
generally they are copies of eachother with extra fields php is quite different but that part is done
